An A/B testing package in proof-of-concept state.

Made by data analysts for data analysts who conduct a/b tests a lot and don't have a good a/b testing manager (or also called an experimenting platform).


## Features

* Validate a/b tests (users that changed groups, missed values in data)
* Conduct a/b tests
* Calc proportion and continuous metrics for each aggregation
* Calc pvalue (including multiple testing correction)
* Draw distribution, pvalue cummulative, timeseries charts
* Print report for a/b tests
* Export report to Excel format

Please see an example jupyter notebook - example.ipynb for demonstration.
